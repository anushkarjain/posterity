# Posterity
A non-profit website which aims at bridging the gap between generations. We aim to connect people, terminate loneliness of our elders and make our kids, kind and responsible. 
This is a very uniwue concept with enables and makes a wonderful use of technology to make evrything accessible to the elderly. Kids will be given rewards for doing little tasks which will keep them motivated to work in future.
